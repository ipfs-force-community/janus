  "title": "Add Support for EIP-1153 (Transient Storage) in the FEVM",
  "description": "Introduce EIP-1153 transient storage to the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM), enabling transaction-scoped temporary data storage via new opcodes TLOAD and TSTORE, for improved compatibility and smart contract functionality.",
  "showDetailedImpact": true,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct impact on storage providers’ operational routines or economics.",
      "Indirectly benefits the ecosystem by enabling more advanced and secure smart contracts, potentially driving network usage and utility."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients interacting with FEVM-based contracts benefit from improved security and efficiency, as developers can use transient storage to implement safe reentrancy and temporary state handling.",
      "Enables more sophisticated decentralized applications on Filecoin, enhancing client experience and reliability."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "Improves the FEVM’s compatibility with Ethereum tooling, attracting more developers and projects to the ecosystem—potentially increasing FIL utility and demand.",
      "No change to token supply, governance, or direct economic parameters, but may indirectly benefit token holders through ecosystem growth."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers gain access to EIP-1153 features (TLOAD, TSTORE), allowing efficient management of transaction-scoped temporary data in smart contracts.",
      "Facilitates safer contract patterns, such as improved reentrancy handling and gas optimization.",
      "Requires minor changes to contract code (inline assembly for TLOAD/TSTORE) and awareness of transient storage lifecycle rules.",
      "Ensures full backward compatibility; legacy contracts remain unaffected unless new features are explicitly used."
