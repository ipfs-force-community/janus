  "description": "Defines v2 of the Filecoin snapshot (CAR) format, embedding an F3 finality certificate snapshot to accelerate node bootstrapping and reduce network bandwidth usage.",
  "showDetailedImpact": true,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct impact on storage providersâ€™ mining or deal operations, but improved node start-up times may benefit operational reliability and upgrades.",
      "Faster bootstrapping enables quicker recovery and onboarding of new nodes, supporting better decentralization and redundancy."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients benefit indirectly from more robust and rapidly accessible Filecoin nodes, increasing overall network reliability for storage and retrieval.",
      "Reduced network bandwidth use for node bootstrapping may improve ecosystem performance and client experience."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "No direct impact on FIL token economics or supply.",
      "Indirect benefits from improved network robustness and decentralization, which may enhance long-term ecosystem value and trust."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers building node software (e.g., Lotus, Forest, Venus) must implement support for v2 snapshot format and F3 data integration.",
      "Snapshot consumers or tooling must be updated for v2, but backward compatibility allows continued use of v1 format during transition.",
      "F3 package maintainers should ensure compatibility for import/export APIs to maintain seamless integration."
