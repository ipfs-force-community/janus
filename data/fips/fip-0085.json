  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct operational impact for storage providers, but strengthens trust in long-term network governance of mining reserve FIL.",
      "Reduces risk that reserve funds could be mismanaged or misused by a small group of keyholders, indirectly supporting fairer incentives and network integrity."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients gain assurance that the mining reserve is governed transparently by network consensus rather than individuals.",
      "No direct effect on client usage or storage guarantees, but increased security and stability of the network incentivizes long-term client engagement."

    "tokenHolders": [
      "Removes individual control over 15% of total FIL supply, placing its governance in the hands of network participants.",
      "Improves transparency and reduces risk of unilateral or collusive actions affecting reserved FIL.",
      "May increase token holder confidence in Filecoinâ€™s governance and decrease perceived risk of centralized control."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "No changes required for most developer tools, APIs, or SDKs unless they interface directly with f090 or multisig actor types.",
      "Developers should be aware that f090 is no longer a multisig and cannot be interacted with as such; it is now a keyless account actor.",
      "Test cases and simulation environments referencing f090 must update actor type and related actor cid expectations."
