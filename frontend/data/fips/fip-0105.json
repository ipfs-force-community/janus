  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "Enables advanced cryptographic primitives such as aggregate signature validation and threshold proofs for storage proofs and consensus, improving efficiency and enabling new protocol features.",
      "Facilitates the implementation of scalable zk-rollup or aggregate proof systems, potentially reducing on-chain data requirements for large storage provider operations."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Improves security and scalability of client-facing applications by allowing efficient BLS signature verification and zk-proof aggregation.",
      "Enables new client features (e.g., batch verification, privacy-preserving proofs) that leverage BLS12-381 cryptography, with no breaking changes to existing client logic."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "Strengthens network security through support for advanced cryptographic protocols, reducing risk of signature forgery and improving verifiability of on-chain actions.",
      "May increase token holder confidence in Filecoinâ€™s ability to support modern cryptographic applications, potentially enhancing token utility and ecosystem value."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Enables direct use of BLS12-381 precompiles for efficient cryptographic operations within smart contracts, eliminating the need for expensive or insecure userland implementations.",
      "Supports development of new dApps (e.g., decentralized voting, threshold cryptography, privacy solutions) that require BLS-based primitives.",
      "No breaking changes for existing contracts, but developers can now migrate to precompiles for substantial gas and performance benefits when using BLS signatures."
