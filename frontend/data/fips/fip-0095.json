  "title": "Add FEVM precompile to fetch beacon digest from chain history",
  "description": "This FIP introduces a precompile to the FEVM allowing smart contracts to fetch drand beacon digests from Filecoin chain history, enabling access to unbiased randomness from prior epochs for advanced proofs and protocols.",
  "showDetailedImpact": false,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct operational or economic impact for storage providers.",
      "Indirectly supports a richer ecosystem by enabling new smart contract protocols that may drive increased demand and use of Filecoin storage."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients interacting with FEVM can now access unbiased randomness from previous epochs, supporting advanced applications such as proof-of-data-possession.",
      "Improves protocol flexibility and supports use-cases that require committed randomness challenges from earlier epochs."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "No direct change to FIL supply, governance, or economics.",
      "By making Filecoin a more capable platform for proofs and off-chain protocols, may indirectly increase FIL utility and ecosystem activity."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers can now build smart contracts requiring unbiased, historical randomness, such as robust proofs-of-service or interactive protocols.",
      "Gas costs scale with depth of lookback, incentivizing efficient protocol design.",
      "New precompile is Filecoin-specific; portability to other EVM chains is limited, but enables unique capabilities in FEVM."
