  "title": "Wallet-Signing Envelope for Arbitrary Messages",
  "description": "Defines a standardized envelope for signing arbitrary messages with Filecoin and FEVM wallets, using version bytes to distinguish contexts and align with Ethereum standards for improved security and interoperability.",
  "showDetailedImpact": true,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct operational impact, but improved wallet and dapp security benefits the whole network ecosystem.",
      "Reduces risk of transaction spoofing or misclassification, supporting more trusted network interactions."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients benefit from enhanced security when signing non-transaction messages, minimizing risks of replay attacks and misinterpretation.",
      "Improved cross-ecosystem compatibility with Ethereum wallets and standards reduces integration friction for client developers."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "Increases user trust by reducing attack vectors in wallet signing, indirectly supporting FILâ€™s reputation and utility.",
      "No direct effect on token economics or governance, but safer wallet practices can strengthen ecosystem stability."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers should update wallet and application signing logic to use the proposed envelope format and version bytes for all arbitrary message signing.",
      "Facilitates easier migration of dapps and tools between Filecoin and Ethereum ecosystems, leveraging familiar standards (EIP-191, EIP-712).",
      "Implementations must ensure proper context discrimination (e.g., chainId, message domain) to avoid replay attacks and other security pitfalls.",
      "No consensus or protocol changes required; updates are at the client/application layer."
