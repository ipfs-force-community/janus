  "title": "Add Cost Opportunity For New Miner Creation",
  "description": "A deposit requirement for creating new miner actors to prevent unnecessary miner ID creation and potential network spam attacks",
  "showDetailedImpact": true,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "A new deposit is required when creating a miner (approximately 10% of the initial pledge for 10 TiB, linearly vested over 180 days), which raises the entry barrier for creating new miner IDs and encourages storage providers to be more cautious when expanding or creating miners.",
      "For active and compliant storage providers, the deposit is eventually released and does not affect long-term revenue, but it introduces short-term liquidity costs.",
      "Storage providers are more likely to reuse existing miner IDs, reducing irrational behaviors such as ID grabbing or deadline competition, thereby optimizing network resource usage.",
      "Small or new storage providers must plan their capital carefully to avoid financial pressure caused by the deposit requirement."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients who store data on the Filecoin network are only indirectly affected by this FIP.",
      "The indirect impact is a healthier network: fewer redundant miner IDs, slower chain state growth, and improved operational efficiency, leading to more stable storage services.",
      "A potential long-term effect is that if some storage providers reduce expansion or exit due to the deposit mechanism, storage supply could be slightly affected, but the overall impact remains limited."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "FIP-0077 does not permanently burn any tokensâ€”the deposit is eventually returned to miners, so it is a temporary lock rather than destruction.",
      "This means there is no direct reduction in circulating supply, but in the short term some FIL will be locked, which may slightly reduce liquidity.",
      "By making the network healthier and more resilient to spam or attacks, the upgrade provides long-term benefits to the ecosystem and stability to FIL value."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers need to adapt to the new miner creation logic, including API parameters, chain state handling, and test cases.",
      "The existing pledge and vesting mechanisms are reused, so implementation cost is relatively low, but compatibility and boundary testing must be considered to ensure a smooth upgrade.",
      "With slower chain state growth and fewer spam miners, future protocol maintenance and iteration will be easier.",
      "SDKs, tools, and related infrastructure need updates and clear upgrade guidance to avoid user-side errors caused by API changes."
