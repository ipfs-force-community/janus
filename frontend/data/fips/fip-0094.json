  "title": "Add Support for EIP-5656 (MCOPY Opcode) in the FEVM",
  "description": "This FIP adds the EIP-5656 MCOPY opcode to the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM), enabling efficient memory copying for smart contracts. This change improves compatibility with the latest Solidity versions and enhances contract performance.",
  "showDetailedImpact": false,
  "impacts": {
    "storageProviders": [
      "No direct operational or economic impact.",
      "Indirect improvement to network utility by enabling more advanced and compatible smart contracts, which can drive ecosystem growth."
    ],
    "clients": [
      "Clients interacting with FEVM contracts benefit from improved contract performance and compatibility with Ethereum tooling.",
      "Supports deployment of contracts compiled with newer Solidity versions, improving client experience and reliability."
    ],
    "tokenHolders": [
      "Improves FEVM’s compatibility with Ethereum, potentially attracting more projects and users to Filecoin, which may increase FIL utility and demand.",
      "No change to token supply, governance, or direct economics, but may benefit token holders via ecosystem growth."
    ],
    "applicationDevelopers": [
      "Developers can use the MCOPY opcode (Solidity >=0.8.25) for efficient memory copying, unlocking new language features and optimizations.",
      "No breaking changes—existing contracts remain unaffected unless they require MCOPY.",
      "Minor updates to tooling may be needed to leverage MCOPY; legacy code remains fully compatible."
